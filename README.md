A lightweight, cross-platform 3D framework created for fun.

The idea here is I will build a simple 3D shading viewer that allow us to test shaders crosses multiple platform & SDK as the 1st step.

I will try to keep all of the modules reusable, and itergrate more features & platforms supportive later, if evey thing goes well.

Then, we will see how far we can achieve.

The DirectX 11 (maybe 12?) on Windows and GNM on PlayStation 4 should be supported first.
